-- Re-created (72) from the body of script 71: + purchase.GoodsReceipts and purchase.GoodsReceiptLines. A goods receipt
-- names its warehouse as surely as an invoice line does (and puts stock there once posted), so a warehouse it names
-- cannot become a parent either. Before the procedures below, which do not call it, and usp_Warehouse_Lookup /
-- _Create / _Update (71), which do.
